# Final Project: Stroke Prediction

### Selected topic
Predicting the likelyhood of a stroke event, based on up to 11 input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, etc.

### Reasons for selecting topic
All four team members work in health care at Mayo Clinic. Also, several team members have family members who have had strokes, including a grandfather and a father, so the topic is a bit personal as well.

### Source data
- Stroke Prediction Dataset, Kaggle
- Fedesoriano, Data Scientist

### Communication protocol
The team is communicating regularly via the following tools:
- Slack channel
