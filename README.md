# Final Project: Stroke Prediction

### Selected topic
Predicting the likelyhood of a stroke event, based on up to 11 input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, etc.

### Reasons for selecting topic
All four team members work in health care at Mayo Clinic. Also, several team members have family members who have had strokes, including a grandfather and a father, so the topic is a bit personal as well.

### Source data
- Stroke Prediction Dataset, Kaggle
- Fedesoriano, Data Scientist
- Contributors: Gaetan Lopez, Bhuvan Chennoju, Joshua Swords

### Questions hoped to get answered
To what extent do factors, such as gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, etc., predict the likelyhood of a person having a stroke?

### Communication protocol
The team is communicating regularly via the following tools:
- Slack channel
- Tuesday & Thursday class times, 7 pm CST
- Daily touchpoints, 8:30 pm CST


## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, connected to AWS.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template for user input via a web form, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard displayed on a web page. It will be hosted on [Heroku?].
