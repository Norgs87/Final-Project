# Final Project: Stroke Prediction

### Selected topic
Predicting the likelyhood of a person having a stroke, based on input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, etc.

### Reasons for selecting topic
All four team members work in health care at Mayo Clinic. Also, several team members have family members who have dealt with strokes, including a grandfather and a father, so the topic is a bit personal as well.
